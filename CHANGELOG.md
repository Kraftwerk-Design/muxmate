# MuxMate Changelog

## 2.0.0 - 2023-10-15
### Added
- Added support for signing URLs  
- Added support for Mux' `max_resolution` param for the `Asset::getMuxStreamUrl()` and `Asset::getMuxVideo()` methods
- Added the `maxResolution` config setting for setting a default max resolution   
- Added the `muxSigningKey` config setting for setting a signing key used in signing URLs
- Added the `defaultPolicy` config setting for setting the default playback policy ("signed" or "public"; public is the default)  
- Added the `_muxmate/create` command for creating Mux assets from existing Craft assets in bulk 
- Added the `_muxmate/create/playback-ids` command for creating new (or missing) Mux playback IDs for existing Mux assets in bulk
- Added the ability to query for assets based on Mux meta data as JSON queries, e.g. `entry.videos.mux({ status: 'ready' }).all()`
### Changed
- Removed the `muxPlaybackId` content table column 

## 1.2.0 - 2023-07-01  
### Added
- Added the ability to have MuxMate automatically lazyload the `<mux-video>` web component
- Added the ability to have MuxMate *not* load the `<mux-video>` web component JS library at all
- Added the `lazyloadMuxVideo` config setting  
- Added the `scriptSrcNonce` config setting  
### Changed
- The `muxVideoUrl` config setting now supports a `false` value, in which case MuxMate will not load the `<mux-video>` library
